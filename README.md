# Life-Expectency-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Using Python, we predict the life expectancy with machine learning's linear regression method of continuous variables from a dataset. We split the dataset into training and test datasets. Later train the linear regression model using Sci-kit model. We finally evaluate the trained model for performance.
